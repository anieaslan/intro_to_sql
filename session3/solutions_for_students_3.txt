Use the customers table from order entry schema to find how many customers are there that have a credit limit over $1000


Use the orders table from order entry schema to find how many orders were made
using direct mode of shopping and how many orders were made using online mode of shopping



Give the total order value for each customer whose orders have been delivered. Please note that the order status is 10 when the order has been delivered to the customers





For customers whose orders are still pending, give the following details: order date, order mode, customer first name, customer last name, order status and order total. Please note that you will have to create a join between orders table and customers table


select o.order_date, o.order_mode, o.order_status, o.order_total, 
c.cust_first_name, c.cust_last_name
from oe.orders o
join oe.customers c
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
where o.order_status < 10;




OBSERVE THE CHANGES

select sum(o.order_total) as Total,
c.cust_first_name, c.cust_last_name
from oe.orders o
join oe.customers c
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
where o.order_status < 10
group by c.cust_first_name, c.cust_last_name;




select sum(o.order_total) as Total,
c.cust_first_name, c.cust_last_name
from oe.orders o
join oe.customers c
on o.customer_id = c.customer_id
where o.order_status < 10
group by c.cust_first_name, c.cust_last_name
having sum(o.order_total) >20000;


Then at the end you can also add an order by clause








Using the orders item table, find the total value for each product ID. 
Total value can be calculated as the sum of quantity * unit value 


-- select product_id, unit_price, sum(quantity)
-- from oe.order_items oi
-- group by product_id, unit_price


select product_id, unit_price*sum(quantity) as Total
from oe.order_items oi
group by product_id, unit_price
